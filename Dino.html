<h3>What is Phylogenies?</h3>
<br>
<p>Phylogenies are intricate maps of evolutionary relationships, tracing the genetic connections among organisms throughout history. They offer a glimpse into the vast tapestry of life, illuminating the shared ancestry and divergent paths of species across time. At their core, phylogenies are constructed based on the analysis of genetic data, such as DNA sequences, enabling scientists to decipher the evolutionary twists and turns that have shaped the natural world.
These evolutionary trees not only provide insights into the past but also serve as invaluable tools for understanding the present and predicting the future. By mapping the evolutionary history of organisms, phylogenies help scientists unravel the mysteries of biodiversity, uncovering patterns of speciation, adaptation, and extinction. They offer a framework for studying the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of ecosystems, shedding light on how organisms interact and evolve in response to changing environments.
Moreover, phylogenies have practical applications across various fields, from medicine to conservation biology. In medicine, they aid in tracing the origins and transmission pathways of diseases, informing strategies for disease prevention and control. In conservation biology, phylogenetic analyses guide efforts to preserve evolutionary diversity and prioritize species for conservation action.
In essence, phylogenies are windows into the evolutionary past, offering a roadmap for exploring the intricate web of life on Earth and guiding our efforts to conserve and understand it.

    <h3>Beginners guide to Taxonomy</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Taxonomy is a science that deals with naming, describing and classification of all living organisms including plants. Classification is based on behavioural, genetic and biochemical variations. Characterization, identification, and classification are the processes of taxonomy. Organisms are classified into similar categories namely:</p>
    <ol>
        <li> Kingdom</li>
        <li>Phylum</li>
        <li>Class</li>
        <li> Order</li>
        <li> Family</li>
        <li> Genus</li>
        <li> Species</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>How to Name a Species: the Taxonomic Process </h3>
    <br>
     <P>Taxonomists begin by sorting specimens to separate sets they believe represent species. Once the specimens are sorted the next job is to see whether or not they already have names. This may involve working through identification guides, reading descriptions written perhaps 200 years ago, and borrowing named specimens from museums or herbaria to compare with the sample. Such comparison may involve external characters, need to dissect internal structures, or even molecular analysis of the DNA. If there is no match the specimens may represent a new species, not previously given a name. The taxonomist then has to write a description, including ways in which the new species can be distinguished from others, and make up a name for it, in a Latin format. The name and the description must then be properly published so that other taxonomists can see what has been done, and be able to identify the species themselves. From finding the specimens to the name appearing in print can take several years.</P>
