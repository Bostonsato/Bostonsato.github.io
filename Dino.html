<h3>Introduction to Phylogenies</h3>
<br>
<p>Phylogenies are intricate maps of evolutionary relationships, tracing the genetic connections among organisms throughout history. They offer a glimpse into the vast tapestry of life, illuminating the shared ancestry and divergent paths of species across time. At their core, phylogenies are constructed based on the analysis of genetic data, such as DNA sequences, enabling scientists to decipher the evolutionary twists and turns that have shaped the natural world.
These evolutionary trees not only provide insights into the past but also serve as invaluable tools for understanding the present and predicting the future. By mapping the evolutionary history of organisms, phylogenies help scientists unravel the mysteries of biodiversity, uncovering patterns of speciation, adaptation, and extinction. They offer a framework for studying the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of ecosystems, shedding light on how organisms interact and evolve in response to changing environments.
Moreover, phylogenies have practical applications across various fields, from medicine to conservation biology. In medicine, they aid in tracing the origins and transmission pathways of diseases, informing strategies for disease prevention and control. In conservation biology, phylogenetic analyses guide efforts to preserve evolutionary diversity and prioritize species for conservation action.
In essence, phylogenies are windows into the evolutionary past, offering a roadmap for exploring the intricate web of life on Earth and guiding our efforts to conserve and understand it.

    <h3>What is Taxonomy?</h3>
    <p>Taxonomy is the science of naming, describing and classifying organisms and includes all plants, animals and microorganisms of the world. Using morphological, behavioural, genetic and biochemical observations, taxonomists identify, describe and arrange species into classifications, including those that are new to science. Taxonomy identifies and enumerates the components of biological diversity providing basic knowledge underpinning management and implementation of the Convention on Biological Diversity. Unfortunately, taxonomic knowledge is far from complete. In the past 250 years of research, taxonomists have named about 1.78 million species of animals, plants and micro-organisms, yet the total number of species is unknown and probably between 5 and 30 million.

    <h3>How to Name a Species: the Taxonomic Process </h3>
     <P>Taxonomists begin by sorting specimens to separate sets they believe represent species. Once the specimens are sorted the next job is to see whether or not they already have names. This may involve working through identification guides, reading descriptions written perhaps 200 years ago, and borrowing named specimens from museums or herbaria to compare with the sample. Such comparison may involve external characters, need to dissect internal structures, or even molecular analysis of the DNA. If there is no match the specimens may represent a new species, not previously given a name. The taxonomist then has to write a description, including ways in which the new species can be distinguished from others, and make up a name for it, in a Latin format. The name and the description must then be properly published so that other taxonomists can see what has been done, and be able to identify the species themselves. From finding the specimens to the name appearing in print can take several years.</P>

        <h3>Phylogeny vs Taxonomy</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Taxonomy is the science of classifying and naming organisms, while phylogeny is the study of the evolutionary relationships between organisms.
            <br>
            In other words, taxonomy is concerned with organizing and naming organisms into hierarchical groups based on their similarities and differences, whereas phylogeny focuses on understanding the evolutionary history and relatedness of these organisms based on genetic, morphological, and other types of data.
            <br>
            While taxonomy deals with the classification and naming of organisms, phylogeny explores the evolutionary relationships between them, revealing their common ancestry and evolutionary history.
