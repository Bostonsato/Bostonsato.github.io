<h3>What is Phylogenies?</h3>
<br>
<p>Phylogenies are intricate maps of evolutionary relationships, tracing the genetic connections among organisms throughout history. They offer a glimpse into the vast tapestry of life, illuminating the shared ancestry and divergent paths of species across time. At their core, phylogenies are constructed based on the analysis of genetic data, such as DNA sequences, enabling scientists to decipher the evolutionary twists and turns that have shaped the natural world.
These evolutionary trees not only provide insights into the past but also serve as invaluable tools for understanding the present and predicting the future. By mapping the evolutionary history of organisms, phylogenies help scientists unravel the mysteries of biodiversity, uncovering patterns of speciation, adaptation, and extinction. They offer a framework for studying the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of ecosystems, shedding light on how organisms interact and evolve in response to changing environments.
Moreover, phylogenies have practical applications across various fields, from medicine to conservation biology. In medicine, they aid in tracing the origins and transmission pathways of diseases, informing strategies for disease prevention and control. In conservation biology, phylogenetic analyses guide efforts to preserve evolutionary diversity and prioritize species for conservation action.
In essence, phylogenies are windows into the evolutionary past, offering a roadmap for exploring the intricate web of life on Earth and guiding our efforts to conserve and understand it.

    <h3>Beginners guide to Taxonomy</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Taxonomy is a science that deals with naming, describing and classification of all living organisms including plants. Classification is based on behavioural, genetic and biochemical variations. Characterization, identification, and classification are the processes of taxonomy. Organisms are classified into similar categories namely:</p>
    <ol>
        <li> Kingdom</li>
        <li>Phylum</li>
        <li>Class</li>
        <li> Order</li>
        <li> Family</li>
        <li> Genus</li>
        <li> Species</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Phylogeny vs. Taxonomy </h3>
    <br>
     <P>While phylogeny is concerned with the evolutionary relatedness and history of organisms, it is not concerned with the identification of these organisms. Rather, it is the main concern of taxonomy. To be more precise, taxonomy is the branch of science that is concerned chiefly with identifying, naming, and classifying organisms. It puts organisms into taxonomic ranks, e.g. domain, kingdom, phylum or division, class, genus, species. Nevertheless, the classification is based on the morphology and phylogeny of organisms, and phylogenetics provides information for use during the identification and classification of organisms. So while taxonomy is concerned chiefly with the identification and classification of organisms, phylogeny provides data for such purpose and a phylogenetic classification would be one that is largely based on molecular phylogeny data.</P>
