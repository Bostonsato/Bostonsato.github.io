            <h1> Hi, I'm Alex To </h1>
            <h3>Fall 2024 Graduate</h3>
            <p>I am graduating in December of 2024 at Sam Houston State University, working towards a degree in Business Management Information Systems. With a strong foundation in both business principles and technical skills, I am seeking job and internship opportunities across the United States in areas such as cyber security, consulting/ risk assurance , data analytics, software development .

                Through my coursework at SHSU, I have gained proficiency in Python, java, SQL, AND HTML/ CSS,  which has provided me with a solid understanding of programming fundamentals, data analytics and web development. 
                
                My goal is to combine my technical and business acumen to contribute effectively to teams and projects, whether in a managerial capacity or a software development role. I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve complex business problems and am eager to apply my skills in a professional setting, where I can continue to learn and grow.
            </p>
