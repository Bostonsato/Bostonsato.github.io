            <h1> Hi, I'm Alex To </h1>
            <h3>Fall 2024 Graduate</h3>
            <P>I am a third-year student at Sam Houston State University, currently pursuing a Bachelor of Business Administration in Management Information Systems. As I approach the final phase of my degree, I am actively seeking internship and job opportunities within the United States that align with my skills and interests, particularly in business management, consulting, and software development   Through my academic journey, I have acquired a solid foundation in key areas of business management and technology. My coursework has provided hands-on experience with various programming languages, including Python and web development technologies like HTML and CSS. These skills have enabled me to understand the intersection of business processes and technology, equipping me to contribute effectively in roles that require both technical and managerial expertise.
                In addition to the structured learning at SHSU, I have taken the initiative to expand my knowledge outside the classroom. I have developed a keen interest in database management systems, particularly Microsoft Access and SQL. This self-driven exploration has sharpened my ability to analyze, design, and manage data, further enhancing my capabilities in business intelligence and decision-making roles.
                I am eager to apply my diverse skill set in real-world environments, where I can make a tangible impact on business operations and technology solutions. My goal is to leverage both my technical background and business acumen to contribute meaningfully to dynamic teams and organizations.
                I am open to opportunities in business management, consulting, software development, and database management, and I look forward to connecting with professionals and organizations that share my passion for innovation and excellence.</P>
